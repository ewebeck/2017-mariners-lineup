    "best": "He gives the Mariners a big boost in athleticism. His great speed is a huge help on defense and his base-stealing puts pressure on opposing teams. He does this while hitting a respectable .280.",

    "prediction": "He saves the Mariners some runs with his defense, but he is a liability at the plate, failing to crack a .700 OPS.",

    "best": "He makes a successful transition from the National League to the American League, and puts up numbers that resemble the outstanding season he had last year with the Arizona Diamondbacks.",
    "worst": "He can't come close to replicating the breakout season he had last year, and his numbers are similar to what he had in 2015 with the Brewers: a .257 average and six homers in 560 at-bats.",
    "prediction": "He hits about .290 with 12 homers and 25 stolen bases, giving the Mariners one of the best middle-infield combinations in baseball.",

    "worst": "After 10 seasons in which he has never played in fewer than 156 games, he spends time on the disabled list. And when healthy, he plays like he did in 2014 and 2015, when he was very solid but not spectacular.",
    "prediction": "Another very good season, if not quite to last year&rsquo;s level. A batting average around .300, with 25 homers and 90 runs batted in seems very doable.",

    "worst": "The remarkable run he has had in his mid-30s can&rsquo;t continue, and his numbers take a dramatic drop.",
    "prediction": "It would seem he could not possibly have another season as good as last year, but the same could have been said before the start of 2015 and 2016. Thirty homers and an OPS around .850 seems likely, another great season but not quite as good as the past three.",

    "worst": "He gets off to another poor start, which seems to be customary, and his fielding woes continue.",
    "prediction": "He will have another good season, hitting about .270 with 25 to 30 home runs and 90 runs batted in. His defense will be improved and he will continue to be one of the team&rsquo;s most respected leaders.",

    "prediction": "There will be some struggles, and he will hit about .260 with 10 home runs, not the production you want from this position.",

Meanwhile his defense and his ability to work with pitchers remains very good.",

    "prediction": "He's going to have a nice season. He will hit about .230 with 20 to 25 home runs and about 70 runs batted in, which will him solidify him as one of the league's better catchers.",

    "prediction": "Something similar to last season, with an average of around .250 with 12 to 15 homers and about 25 stolen bases. That should satisfy the Mariners as long as his defense remains strong.",
